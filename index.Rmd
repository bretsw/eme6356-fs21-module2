# Correlation as proxy

> Correlations let us analyze a phenomenon not by shedding light on its inner working but by identifying a useful proxy for it... With correlations, there is no certainty, only probability.

>...how Google could "predict" the spread of the winter flu in the United States, not just nationally, but down to specific regions and even states. The company could achieve this by looking at what people were searching for on the Internet. Since Google receives more than three billion search queries every day and saves them all, it had plenty of data to work with.

> Knowing why might be pleasant, but it's unimportant for stimulating sales... Knowing *what*, not *why*, is good enough.

> We had to use all the data, as much as we could possibly collect, not just a small portion. We needed to accept messiness rather than treat exactitude as a central priority. And we had to put our trust in correlations without fully knowing the causal basis for the predictions.

> ...the data deluge makes the scientific method obsolete.

> With enough data, the numbers speak for themselves. Petabytes allow us to say: "Correlation is enough."

> Admittedly, chilling people's freedom to interact with information would be terrible. On the other hand, the benefit is that making insurance easier and less expensive to obtain may result in more insured people, which is a good thing for society, not to mention insurance firms.
